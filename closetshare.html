            <strong>ClosetShare</strong> is an app that aims to inspire individuals to <strong>enhance their fashion sense and discover their unique 
            style.</strong> It provides a platform for fashion enthusiasts to <strong>connect, share, and engage with local and global fashion communities.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Users can <strong>showcase their outfits</strong> by uploading photos and sharing detailed information about each piece, including where they were 
            purchased, making it easier for others to find and buy similar items. Also, the app allows users to <strong>explore a wide range of outfit 
            inspirations</strong>, fostering creativity and collaboration. 
          </p>
          <p>
            ClosetShare’s goal is to bridge the gap between personal style and community-driven fashion, encouraging self-expression and shared inspiration.

            People who are unfamiliar with fashion or how to look good, and need inspirations from other people.

              As I was seeking appropriate app ideas, I looked to one common question many ask every morning:  <strong>“What do I wear today?”</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Using platforms such as Pinterest as inspirations, I came to the app idea of a platform that not only specializes in providing 
              outfit ideas for its users, but provide tools to help users replicate these outfit ideas.
  
            </p>
            <p>
              To theatrically ensure a consistent flow of outfit ideas, I also proposed outfit sharing to be another primary feature, backed 
              up by a ranking system as further incentive for engagement.

              <p>
                For the app’s font and color choices, my partner and I aimed to create an <strong>elegant and luxurious atmosphere</strong>, but still 
                <strong>welcoming</strong> enough for the general audience.
              </p>
              <p>
                For these purposes, I proposed using a <strong>vibrant purple</strong>, a color that often represents luxury and royalty, as the app’s 
                highlight color. The rest of the app visuals were kept <strong>neutral and subtle</strong> to help push the outfit pictures 
                as primary focuses. 
              </p>
              <p>
                For typography, I selected <strong>Poppins for titles and Nunito for body text and captions</strong>. They conveys a sense of 
                <strong>elegance and clarity, while still feeling friendly and minimalistic</strong>.

            Development plans will likely need to be 
            adjusted as issues emerge. Therefore, being <strong>able to adapt the plan and development process to navigate around and resolve these 
            issues</strong> is an important skill to have.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example emerged during development was when 
            I needed to <strong>allocated time during development to research and implement other external storage means</strong> as firebase had proven ineffective
            in image storage, which I managed to pull through
            by integrating Imgur API.

        <h2>Design choice vs implementation </h2>

            <p>
              Due to the project having a strict time limit, there were occasions where I had to opt for a simpler approach for design 
              implementations, as any design that I’ve made will also need to be implemented through code. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Such as the waterfall 
              like card layout that naturally guides the user’s eyes downwards, where a simpler parallel layout was used for actual implementation instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Development feasibility is something that should also be taken into account during initial ideation steps</strong>, 
              especially when constraints are in play.
