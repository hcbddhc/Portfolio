            <strong>ClosetShare</strong> is an app that aims to inspire individuals to <strong>enhance their fashion sense and discover their unique 
            style.</strong> It provides a platform for fashion enthusiasts to <strong>connect, share, and engage with local and global fashion communities.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Users can <strong>showcase their outfits</strong> by uploading photos and sharing detailed information about each piece, including where they were 
            purchased, making it easier for others to find and buy similar items. Also, the app allows users to <strong>explore a wide range of outfit 
            inspirations</strong>, fostering creativity and collaboration. 
          </p>
          <p>
            ClosetShare’s goal is to bridge the gap between personal style and community-driven fashion, encouraging self-expression and shared inspiration.

          </p>
          <p>
            Using platforms such as Pinterest as inspirations, I came to the app idea of a platform that not only specializes in providing 
            outfit ideas for its users, but provide tools to help users replicate these outfit ideas.

          </p>
          <p>
            To theatrically ensure a consistent flow of outfit ideas, I also proposed outfit sharing to be another primary feature, backed 
            up by a ranking system as further incentive for engagement.

          <div>
            <h2>App Stylings</h2>
            <p>
              For the app’s font and color choices, my partner and I aimed to create an <strong>elegant and luxurious atmosphere</strong>, but still 
              <strong>welcoming</strong> enough for the general audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              For these purposes, I proposed using a <strong>vibrant purple</strong>, a color that often represents luxury and royalty, as the app’s 
              highlight color. At the same time, keep the <strong>rest of the app visuals neutral and subtle</strong> to help push the outfit pictures 
              as primary focuses. 
            </p>
            <p>
              For typography, I selected <strong>Poppins for titles and Nunito for body text and captions</strong>. The fonts help conveys a sense of 
              <strong>elegance and clarity, while still feeling friendly and minimalistic</strong>, complementing the visual identity that we had 
              envisioned.

    <h1>Key Reflections</h1>
    <div class = "sub-section">
      <h2><strong>Adaption</strong> is Key</h2>
      <p>
        While it is important to lay out development plans as well as set deadline and goals early on, these plans will likely need to be 
        adjusted as issues emerge. Therefore, being <strong>able to adapt the plan and development process to navigate around and resolve these 
        issues</strong> is an important skill to have.
      </p>
      <p>
        One major issue that arise was our initial plan to only utilize Firebase for outfit data storage. Later in the development process, 
        we found that image data is too big for the limited amount of external storage we have access to via Firebase. So we had to repivot
         and seek alternative means of image storage instead. Consequently, I <strong>allocated time during development for research of other 
         external storage means, and Imgur API’s integration</strong> after I’ve chosen it for its unlimited storage space.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "sub-section">
      <h2>Design choice vs implementation </h2>
      <div id = "closetshare-reflection-B-content" class = "grid-area">
        <div>
          <p>
            As the project encompasses both design and development, any design that I’ve made, I’ll need to make it a reality through code. 
            Due to the project having a strict time limit, there were occasions where I had to opt for a simpler approach for design 
            implementations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such as the outfit card displays while browsing outfits. While the finalized mockup design illustrated an asymmetrical, waterfall 
            like card layout that naturally guides the user’s eyes downwards, implementing it in React Native have proven troublesome.

            One key takeaway is that <strong>development feasibility is something that should also be taken into account during initial ideation steps</strong>, 
            especially when constraints are in play. If we had more time however, we would definitely prioritize implementing all finalized design choices, as well as
            tackle some current visual consistency issues.
