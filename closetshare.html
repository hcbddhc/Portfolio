            How might we know more about the deficiencies of current avenues available for people looking to find outfit 
            inspirations or to improve their own style?

              Many men and women across demographics are looking to dress better, highlighting a <strong>strong demand for fashion inspirations</strong>. 
              On Reddit, fashion advice communities such as r/malefashionadvice has over 6.3 million followers, 
              and r/femalefashionadvice has over 5.8 million, each with more than 500k weekly visitors.  
            </p>
            <p>
              To understand how people currently learn about fashion, including their pain points and market gaps, 
              I analyzed current online avenues across Reddit, YouTube, and Discord.

          Fashion lovers need a platform that not only showcases real outfits from real everyday people, 
          but also <strong>accommodates diverse body types</strong>, offers <strong>precise search and filter tools</strong>, 
          and helps users <strong>find the exact pieces</strong> they need to recreate those looks.

            <h2>Initial App Architecture Template</h2>
            <p>
              Using platforms such as Pinterest as inspirations, I came to the app idea of a platform that not only specializes in providing 
              outfit ideas for its users, but provide tools to help users replicate these outfit ideas. To theatrically ensure a consistent flow of outfit ideas, I also proposed outfit sharing to be another primary feature, backed 
              up by a ranking system as further incentive for engagement.

            <h2>App Stylings</h2>
            <div class = "paragraph-with-break">
              <p>
                For the app’s font and color choices, my partner and I aimed to create an <strong>elegant and luxurious atmosphere</strong>, but still 
                <strong>welcoming</strong> enough for the general audience.
              </p>
              <p>
                For these purposes, I proposed using a vibrant purple, a color that often represents <strong>luxury and royalty</strong>, as the app’s 
                highlight color. The rest of the app visuals were kept <strong>neutral and subtle</strong> to help push the outfit pictures 
                as primary focuses. 
              </p>
              <p>
                For typography, I selected Poppins for titles and Nunito for body text and captions. They conveys a sense of 
                <strong>elegance and clarity, while still feeling friendly and minimalistic</strong>.

        <h2><strong>Adaption</strong> is Key</h2>
        <div class = "paragraph-with-break">
          <p>
            Development plans will likely need to be 
            adjusted as issues emerge. Therefore, being <strong>able to adapt the plan and development process to navigate around and resolve these 
            issues</strong> is an important skill to have.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example emerged during development was when 
            I needed to <strong>allocated time during development to research and implement other external storage means</strong> as firebase had proven ineffective
            in image storage, which I managed to pull through
            by integrating Imgur API.

        <h2>Design choice vs implementation </h2>

          <div class = "paragraph-with-break">
            <p>
              Due to the project having a strict time limit, there were occasions where I had to opt for a simpler approach for design 
              implementations, as any design that I’ve made will also need to be implemented through code. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Such as the waterfall 
              like card layout that naturally guides the user’s eyes downwards, where a simpler parallel layout was used for actual implementation instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Development feasibility is something that should also be taken into account during initial ideation steps</strong>, 
              especially when constraints are in play.
