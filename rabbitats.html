          <p>Taking the 4 weeks project duration constraint into account, I was one of the parities arguing against tackling every single 
            aspect of the website during the initial brainstorming process, as it is to my firm belief that it is more ideal to <strong>target 
            specific pain points and weaknesses</strong> and make appropriate, realistic solutions that would <strong>best fit the organization’s unique goals.</strong>
          </p>
    
          <p>As the leading researcher during beginning steps, I’ve done extensive research on not just the <strong>organization itself to 
            understand its missions and activities</strong>, but the greater context as well, being the continuous population growth of local 
            rabbit colonies.  Being the only member that’s located in Richmond at the time also provided me additional reference point 
            to draw from.</p>

          <p>From not just my personal experiences, but as well as local news report and social forum insights, one common theme in relation to pet rabbit abandonments, is the <strong>lack of education among current and prospective rabbit keepers.</strong></p>
          <p>With this in mind, on top of a thorough evalution of Rabbitat's website, I proposed <strong>education as the prospective design focus</strong>, and the direction of improving the education 
            experience for prospective and current rabbit adopters navigating the current website. As my evaluation had concluded that 
            Rabbitat’s website is far behind in this area compare to other aspects such as donations and adoptions.</p>

       <p>
        Upon extensive research on the organization, the context, and the website itself, I’ve proposed <strong>two main problems</strong> of the current 
        website in which we can effectively and realistically resolve given the various constraints.

            <h4>Education not given prominence and is given a lower hierarchy</h4>
            <p>Looking more into the wild rabbit epidemic in the greater Metro Vancouver area, one main source for this can be traced back 
              to pet abandonment caused by a lack of knowledge when it comes to rabbit keeping. This, on top of Rabbitats goals, means that
                education should be a key aspect of the webpage.</p>
            <p>Yet despite education having its own page, this <strong>entire aspect of the page is barely showcased and promoted on the home page</strong>, 
              in which heavily reduces engagement. Instead, the focus is placed on the other 3 areas, recruiting volunteers, donations, and 
              adoptions.</p>

            <h4>User-unfriendly education page</h4>

              through 50 pages of hard to digest content. The page also includes a singular video from Rabbitat’s YouTube channel and two 
              downloadable pdf files.</p>
            <p>The <strong>form in which the content comes in is insufficient and not user friendly</strong>, and does not promote ease of access 
              for prospective readers. The information being external to the website <strong>harms the site’s overall cohesiveness and increases the 
              barrier for information retrieval</strong>. This design has also make it extremely difficult for prospective users to access or search for specific content.</p>

    <!--------------------------KEY REFLECTIONS //-------------------------------------------------->
    <section id = "key-reflections">
      <h1>Key Reflections</h1>
      <p>
        This month long project is one of my first cracks into a time based collaborative design project, as well as the experience of 
        playing more of a leadership role. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One key aspect of this redesign is the need for a <strong>realistic yet still effective scoping</strong> for the prototype. Given the time limit, 
        I’ve determined that it is key to target specific weak points on the website (after researching the client and its goals) instead 
        of redesigning the entire website. As too large of a scope will result in the team being too spread out, leading to a less 
        effective redesign.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another key is the <strong>importance of proper research</strong>, and the need to <strong>personalize the design strategy for each client</strong>. The main problems
         and associated solutions are all rooted back to our extensive research on the organization itself and the environmental concerns 
         surrounding it. Without that knowledge and the organization’s needs in mind, the solution would not had been as appropriate.
