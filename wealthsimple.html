            Investing is an activity everyone should participate in to better their long term financial wellness. The benefits provided by investing is especially valuable among youth, as getting a headstart early would yield the best results long term. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I, along with two peers, seek to <strong>explore methods of design that can encourage young adults to invest early in their lifetime to maximize long term financial stability.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            With contribution from my peers, I finalized a research questionnaire targeting those aged 19 to 29 that inquired participants
             regarding their <strong>knowledge and opinion of investment as an activity, as well as their confidence level.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on insights gathered from the questionnaire’s 21 responses, we formulated the following design problem statement:

          There currently lacks an accessible and centralized source of information for young people to get started on long term investments, as the frequently fragmented learning sources raises the barrier of entry.

            <p>To best tackle this problem, I <strong>advocated for exploring existing investment related platforms as points of intervention</strong> over 
              designing a new one, and finalized Wealthsimple as that platform.</p>
            <p>Wealthsimple is a Canadian platform that provides investment services to the public, with the aim to help everyone achieve 
              financial freedom. It was a popular platform referenced within our questionnaire responses. Online consensus gathered from 
              initial research also indicates Wealthsimple as a popular starting point for investing among youth.</p>

           The team navigated the Wealthsimple app to collect insights and perform UX
            evaluations, while performed HCI research for possible solutions. My research domain for this phase of the project comprised of <strong>visual 
            analytics, distributed cognition frameworks, mental models, and information foraging theory.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            As an experienced Wealthsimple user, I was also able to <strong>provide additional insights based on my personal experience and investment related

                Research from other team members have concluded that processing new information leads to a cognitive load on the learner which can contributes 
                towards poorer decision-making specifically with risk analysis, and increased difficulty to absorb new information.

            Following up on my research of mental model theories, investing as a concept appears to <strong>lack concrete connection with any existing
            physical phenomenon, as it is a digital concept</strong>. This combined with a general unfamiliarity of investing among youth makes 
            existing mental models, such as portfolio as personal assets and interactive graphs, abstract and disconnecting for young, 
            new investors.

              <p>
                Support from external sources are hard to come by for newer investors. The process of investing is quite <strong>individual oriented</strong> 
                with social collaboration being largely absent due to its
                private nature. Additionally,  <strong>fragmented sources of information</strong> complicates decision making, as
                investors need to evaluate a large number of external sources such as online forums, videos, financial news.

            With the research insights and intervention goals, we proposed a number of redesigns and new features that can help tackle the problem space.

            I advocated for transforming the portfolio holdings screen from a simple list into a <strong>visualized and 
            interactable pie chart</strong>, a more accurate and recognizable form of representation that organized information into <strong>clear 
            categories</strong>. Users can also choose between different methods of categorization or switch back to
            the classic list view via a toggle.

            To allow collaboration between different users to offload the mental load, I proposed an optional community based feature 
            that allows users to <strong>share their own portfolios</strong> and receive collaborative feedback through likes, Q&As, and other user comments.
             Users can also view other shared portfolios and ask questions as an <strong>information source.</strong>

            I redesigned Wealthsimple’s performance chart to communicate more information through visuals in a digestible manner. 
            I’ve added more <strong>relevant data visualization and supporting elements</strong> to help with understanding.

          <h2>Design solutions should be based on evidence</h2>
          <p>
            For my design proposals that aims to ease investment learning curve and provide additional tools to support users during the 
            investment process, all solutions are evidence based, and results of extensive research of peer reviewed research. When 
            design is <strong>based on well founded research and concrete evidence</strong>, and not simply subjective assumptions, they become far more 
            justifiable.

          <h2>Importance of “unflattening” in design</h2>
          <p>
            Through this project, I experienced first hand the value in the idea of “unflattening”, taking information and knowledge from a 
            diverse set of fields, and combining them to for design solutions. During our research, we explored human cognition theories, 
            social dynamics, economics, and more. Even if these fields and surrounding research seem distant from interface design at a first 
            glance, the evidence collected from these fields still plays an important role in shaping effective solutions.
