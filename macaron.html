        <p>For this two person project, while my partner concentrated on crafting a strong and distinctive brand identity through the 
          creation of the logo, supporting visuals, and selecting cohesive colors and fonts, my role focused more so on <strong>web design and 
          development, as well as create an user experience that aligns seamlessly with said brand's identity.</strong>

          <p>
            A small Montreal-based patisserie, well known for making light, airy macarons and their cute mascot (a mouse named Ronnie)
          </p>
          <p>
            The company targets customers of all ages, but especially those with an affinity for cute things and good desserts, individuals who 
            post their food on social media with carefully crafted captions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Macaron entices potential consumers by offering a seamless ordering experience, with consistent visual design to promote the brand’s 
            reliability - if the website looks so good, imagine how good the macarons taste...

              product images throughout the entire website</strong>, while allocating other elements as subtle backdrops. </p>
            <p>However, I still aimed to find ways to better integrate the <strong>brand’s hand-drawn cartoonish design as the site’s complementary visual language</strong>, 
              ensuring a cohesive look that enhances the brand’s unique identity.</p>

            <h4>An Efficient Shopping Experience for Users</h4>
            <p>The primary function of the website: the online shopping aspect, is one of my major focus while designing the website. My philosophy during development
             is that, not only should this process be visually aesthetically pleasing to maintain the brand’s playful tone, this process should first and foremost 
             be an seamless experience for users seeking to purchase macarons on the website.</p>

            <h4>Organized Code System for Better Collaboration</h4>
            <p>As the primary web developer, I took the lead in structuring the codebase to enhance collaboration with my partner as new features and pages were 
              added. </p>
            <p>I prioritized creating a readable and well-organized foundation, iteratively refining HTML and CSS elements throughout development to minimize 
              technical debt. </p>
            <p>The resulting code system allows for more time to be dedicated to proper visual hierarchy, optimizing page layouts, and refining aesthetic details, 
              helping me in creating a seamless user experience while using the company’s website.</p>

    <!--------------------------KEY REFLECTIONS //-------------------------------------------------->
    <section id = "key-reflections">
      <h1>Key Reflections</h1>
      <p>
        For this project, instead of focusing on more creative decisions, such as which font to use, which colour is fitting for the brand, 
        what kind of aesthetics should the site utilize, my focus was to take into account an existing brand and aesthetics, and figure out a way to
         best make it shine, as well as focusing on the user experience as they navigate through the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, as the project involves more than just design, and involves the development of the website as well using HTML, this highlighted the importance of 
        clear communication between team members for me, especially through proper code organization and clear comments. Maintaining a structured and well 
        documented codebase was essential to ensure smooth development and effective collaboration.
