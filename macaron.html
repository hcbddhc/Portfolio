                The company targets customers of all ages, but especially those with an affinity for cute things and good desserts, individuals who

        <p>
          For this project, my focus was to take into account an existing brand and aesthetics, and figure out a way to
           best make it shine, as well as focusing on the user experience as they navigate through the site. I've found constant communcation with the brand designer
           to be the main key of success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, as the project involves more than just design, and involves code implementation, it highlighted the importance of 
          clear communication between team members, especially through proper code organization and clear comments. Maintaining a structured and well 
          documented codebase was essential to ensure smooth development and effective collaboration.
