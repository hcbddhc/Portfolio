          <p>
            Secondary research have supported that Vancouver based small independent artisans in the handmade craft business faces problems such as currently earning below-average revenue and 
            having a volatile source of income. Consequently, it is difficult to transform a small handmade craft business into a successful,  livable career.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          CraftConnect is a proposed web platform that allows handcraft consumers to <strong>learn about, connect, and support their local artisans through various 
          interactive features</strong> such as a map overview of nearby artisan shops, and an interactive booth page with customized notes sent to artisans, news boards,
          and more. It also serves as a <strong>centralized source of information</strong> about local artisans and the avenues they participate in.

        <div>
          <p>
            The platform was created after four months of <strong>research, interviews, and continuous iterations</strong> with a team of four. With the initial objective to resolve 
            the high difficulty for handcraft artisans to transform their craft into a successful business, we later directed our design focus to be establishing an
             effective process for facilitating <strong>customer awareness of local artisans</strong>, and fostering <strong>meaningful connections.</strong> Consequently, CraftConnect is our 
             solution to this design focus.

            How might we learn the methods by which artisans in the craft business build up their presence for local in-person avenues (local shops, events),
            and whether these methods are effective or not?

            <p>
              During initial research, I <strong>pioneered the primary research process</strong> helped with planning for this phase of the project. I mapped out a number of artisan avenues and assigned each team member to investigate along with a pre-set schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later on, I contacted over 30 local artisans and major handcraft consumers, and was able to arrange 5 interviews. I also served as the main interviewer for most of the interview process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The conducted research revealed the importance of <strong>finding a niche dedicated target base</strong> for financial stability, yet currently artisans have <strong>limited opportunities to form meaningful connections</strong> with their customers. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Existing measures used in artisan shops tend to be ignored by customers, while markets and individual booths suffer from lower traffic due to the over reliance on word of mouth advertising.

              With my business background in mind, I first proposed a <strong>post-purchase appreciation and sticker collection program</strong> that aims to improve upon existing shop’s lackluster measures to ensure customers remember the artisan they purchase from.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, later feedback and analysis concluded that the idea was <strong>limited in scope</strong> and mainly benefited artisans already selling in craft shops, while also posing <strong>risk of excessive waste and logistical challenges.</strong> Henceforth, I proposed that we digitalize the concept, and include elements from other proposed ideas, such as the got Craft Interactive Initiative,  in this concept.

          <p>
            This project’s long time duration allows for an opportunity to perform extensive research on our initially selected subject matter, and an opportunity to 
            diverge, converge, or repivot concept and solutions. It is through these opportunities that I truly understood the significance of <strong>always seeking external
            and diverse perspectives and opinions.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn't until I’ve actually visited artisan avenues, observed how things are 
            currently being done, and talked to various stakeholders, that possible points of intervention begin to emerge.  <strong>None of the 
            proposed solutions would had came to fruition without the insights gained from seeking these perspectives through field research.</strong> 
          </p>
          <p>
            If we were to have more time, I would definitely advocate for additional user testing to identity further insights, potential improvements, and the 
            effectiveness of the finalized direction. As design as this project have proven, is a <strong>continuous iterative process.</strong>
